This is a series of faculty projects I did for my Digital Image Processing (DIP) course.
Link to [School of Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/), University of Belgrade web site.

### Requirements
To run the programs you will need:
* MATLAB (any version should be ok)

### project#1 - Mosaic ([code](https://github.com/gordicaleksa/digital-image-processing/blob/master/project1/))
