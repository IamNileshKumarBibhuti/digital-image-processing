# Digital Image Processing projects
This is a series of faculty projects I did for my Digital Image Processing (DIP) course. <br />
Link to [School of Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/), University of Belgrade web site.

### Requirements
To run the programs you will need:
* MATLAB (any version should be ok)

### project#1 - Mosaic ([code](https://github.com/gordicaleksa/digital-image-processing/blob/master/project1/))
**Getting started:**

* Download the code and **run the main.m** (2 new figures will popup and 2 new files will be saved to **example_output/**)
* If you wish to use your own images just **change the paths in the main.m** to a path to your images
* Images are **automatically saved to example_output/** directory as files simple_mosaic.png and mosaic.png 
* You can play with 2 implementations [here](https://github.com/gordicaleksa/digital-image-processing/blob/master/project1/create_mosaic.m) and see the results sometimes the contrast is better with 1. implementation.
(images should be small so that the output image is not too big for displaying)

**Results:**

small/building block image:

big image whose mosaic you want to create out of small images:

intermediate result:

as the final result you get this (using the second implementation from [here](https://github.com/gordicaleksa/digital-image-processing/blob/master/project1/create_mosaic.m))
